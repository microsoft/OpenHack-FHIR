# Challenge00 - Pre-requisites

#### The below lists the Installation Prerequisites technical and Knowledge References needed to complete all challenges.

## Installation Prerequisites
* **NOTE**: This version of the OpenHack assumes hackers are on a **Windows client machine**, but hints are included for `*nix` users.
* **Download this Github to your local drive.**

### Needs to be installed before starting Challenge01:
* **1**. Check if you have one of the below **Azure Subscription**
   * Your Work Internal Subscription
   * Visual Studio Subscription
   * [Free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)


**NOTE**: If you going to use **CloudShell to deploy Azure API for FHIR go to step 3**. If you are going to use **PowerShell complete below steps**. 


* **2**. **(Optional) Microsoft Powershell**: 
   * **2.1**. You will need powershell in order to run the operations in this document. The correct installation steps for your platform can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7).

   * **2.2**. **Install prerequisite PowerShell modules**: While there are other options, we recommend PowerShell scripts in Windows for challenges in this Github. **Run PowerShell as Administrator**.
      * **NOTE**: This section lists versions for Az and AzureAD modules. If you are having PowerShell issues in [Challenge01](../Challenge01-AzureAPIforFHIR/ReadMe.md), double-check all [PowerShell Modules](./powershell.txt).
      * Get PowerShell module version: Make sure your version is 5.1. If not, install [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616) version.
         ```powershell
         $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
         ```  
      * Get Azure PowerShell module versions: If your results show Az version 4.1.0 and AzureAd version 2.0.2.4, then proceed to login step. If not, get the right versions.
         ```powershell
         Get-InstalledModule -Name Az -AllVersions
         Get-InstalledModule -Name AzureAd -AllVersions
         ```  

      * If these aren't the versions you have installed, uninstall and re-install PowerShell modules: Uninstall Az and AzureAd modules and install the right version needed. 
         ```powershell
         Uninstall-Module -Name Az
         Uninstall-Module -Name AzureAD
         ```  

         ```powershell
         Install-Module -Name Az -RequiredVersion 4.1.0 -Force -AllowClobber -SkipPublisherCheck
         Install-Module AzureAD -RequiredVersion 2.0.2.4
         ```
         NOTE: If you get an error that AzureRM Module is conflicting with Az Module, run the below
         ```powershell
         Uninstall-Module -Name AzureRM
         ```  

      * **NOTE**: If you are using a **`*nix` platform (Mac or Linux)**, you will need to install the `AzureAD.Standard.Preview` module instead of `AzureAD`:
         ```powershell
         # Step 1: If you already installed the AzureAD module, uninstall it
         Uninstall-Module AzureAD

         # Step 2: Add a package source for AzureAD.Standard.Preview module
         Register-PackageSource -Trusted -ProviderName 'PowerShellGet' -Name 'Posh Test Gallery' -Location https://www.poshtestgallery.com/api/v2/

         # Step 3: Install and import AzureAD.Standard.Preview module
         Install-Module AzureAD.Standard.Preview
         Import-Module AzureAD.Standard.Preview
         ```

   * **2.3**. Current Release of **[Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest&tabs=azure-cli)**
   * **2.4**. **[.NET Core 3.1 (SDK)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)**

* **3**. **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)**
* **3**. ** or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [REST Client Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)**

* **4**. **Optional** [Java 1.8 (JDK, not JRE install)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html). Java [JRE vs SE vs JDK](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/techinfo.html).

### Needs to be installed before starting Challenge02:
**NOTE**: If you going to use **PaaS endpoint to convert HL7 to FHIR**, skip this section. If you are going to use **Open Source to convert HL7 to FHIR and load into FHIR server, complete below steps**. 
* **5**. Linux Subsystem for Windows
   * **5.1**. **[If you are running Windows 10, enable Windows Linux Subsystem](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial#_enable-wsl).** You can use Windows Dialog or PowerShell. Restart Windows.
   * **5.2**. **[Ubuntu](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial#_install-a-linux-distro).** You can install from the Microsoft Store by using the store app or by searching for Ubuntu in the Windows search bar.
   * **5.3**. **Azure CLI 2.0** on [Ubuntu One Command Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-apt?view=azure-cli-latest#install-with-one-command). Run the below in Ubuntu.
